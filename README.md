1. The set of encrypted images we used in our paper totals several hundred gigabytes, and a single encrypted image set alone is approximately 10 gigabytes.  Therefore, it is impossible to upload all of them to GitHub.
2. Here we present the randomly selected image dataset that we have used.  Readers can independently generate the ciphertext dataset mentioned in the text by using the our OpenSSL scripts.
